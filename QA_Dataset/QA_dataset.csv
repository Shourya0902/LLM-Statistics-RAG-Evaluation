Probability,"Explain what is wrong with the following statements. Use complete sentences.
1. If there is a 60% chance of rain on Saturday and a 70% chance of rain on Sunday, then there
is a 130% chance of rain over the weekend.
2. The probability that a baseball player hits a home run is greater than the probability that he
gets a successful hit. ","1. You can’t calculate the joint probability knowing the probability of both events occurring,
which is not in the information given; the probabilities should be multiplied, not added; and
probability is never greater than 100%
2. A home run by definition is a successful hit, so he has to have at least as many successful hits
as home runs. "
Probability,"Let event C = taking an English class. Let event D = taking a speech class.
Suppose P(C) = 0.75, P(D) = 0.3, P(C|D) = 0.75 and P(C AND D) = 0.225.
Justify your answers to the following questions numerically. 
1. Are C and D independent?
2. Are C and D mutually exclusive?
3. What is P(D|C)? ","1. Yes, because P(C|D) = P(C).
2. No, because P(C AND D) is not equal to zero.
3. P(D|C) = P(C AND D) / P(C)= 0.225/0.75= 0.3 "
Probability,"An experiment consists of tossing a nickel, a dime, and a quarter. Of interest is the side the coin
lands on.
1. List the sample space.
2. Let A be the event that there are at least two tails. Find P(A).
3. Let B be the event that the first and second tosses land on heads. Are the events A
and B mutually exclusive? Explain your answer in one to three complete sentences,
including justification. ","1. S = {(HHH), (HHT), (HTH), (HTT), (THH), (THT), (TTH), (TTT)}
2. 4/8
3. Yes, because if A has occurred, it is impossible to obtain two tails. In other words, P(A
AND B) = 0. "
Probability,"Roll one fair, six-sided die. The sample space is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Let event A = a face is odd. Then A =
{1, 3, 5}. Let event B = a face is even. Then B = {2, 4, 6}.
• Find the complement of A, A′. The complement of A, A′, is B because A and B together make
up the sample space. P(A) + P(B) = P(A) + P(A′) = 1. Also, P(A) = 3/6 and P(B) = 3/6 .
• Let event C = odd faces larger than two. Then C = {3, 5}. Let event D = all even faces smaller
than five. Then D = {2, 4}. P(C AND D) = 0 because you cannot have an odd and even face at
the same time. Therefore, C and D are mutually exclusive events.
• Let event E = all faces less than five. E = {1, 2, 3, 4}.
Are C and E mutually exclusive events? (Answer yes or no.) Why or why not? ","No. C = {3, 5} and E = {1, 2, 3, 4}. P(C AND E) = 1/6. To be mutually exclusive, P(C AND E) must be
zero.
We can also find P(C|A), a conditional probability. Recall that the event C is {3, 5} and event A is {1, 3,
5}. To find P(C|A), find the probability of C using the sample space A. You have reduced the sample
space from the original sample space {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} to {1, 3, 5}. So, P(C|A) = 2/3. "
Probability,"United Blood Services is a blood bank that serves more than 500 hospitals in 18 states. According
to their website, a person with type O blood and a negative Rh factor (Rh-) can donate blood to
any person with any blood type. Their data show that 43% of people have type O blood and 15% of
people have Rh- factor; 52% of people have type O or Rh- factor.
1. Find the probability that a person has both type O blood and the Rh- factor.
2. Find the probability that a person does NOT have both type O blood and the Rh- factor. ","1. P(type O OR Rh-) = P(type O) + P(Rh-) – P(type O AND Rh-)
0.52 = 0.43 + 0.15 – P(type O AND Rh-); solve to find P(type O AND Rh-) = 0.06
6% of people have type O, Rh- blood
2. P(NOT(type O AND Rh-)) = 1 – P(type O AND Rh-) = 1 – 0.06 = 0.94
94% of people do not have type O, Rh- blood "
Probability,"In a basketball arena,
• 70% of the fans are rooting for the home team.
• 25% of the fans are wearing blue.
• 20% of the fans are wearing blue and are rooting for the away team.
• Of the fans rooting for the away team, 67% are wearing blue.
Let A be the event that a fan is rooting for the away team. 
Let B be the event that a fan is wearing blue.
Are the events of rooting for the away team and wearing blue independent? Are they mutually
exclusive?","P(B|A) = 0.67
P(B) = 0.25
So P(B) does not equal P(B|A) which means that B and A are not independent (wearing blue and
rooting for the away team are not independent). They are also not mutually exclusive, because P(B
AND A) = 0.20, not 0. "
Probability,"A school has 200 seniors of whom 140 will be going to college next year. Forty will be going directly to work. 
The remainder are taking a gap year. Of the seniors going to college, fifty play sports. Of the seniors going
 directly to work, thirty play sports. Five of the seniors taking a gap year play sports.

1. What is the probability that a senior is taking a gap year?
2. Are “taking a gap year” and “playing sports” independent events?
3. Are “going to college” and “taking a gap year” independent events?","1. (200 - 140 - 40) / 200 = 20 / 200 = 0.1

2. Let A = “taking a gap year” and B = “playing sports.”
P(A) = 0.1 from step one.
P(B) = (50 + 30 + 5) / 200 = 85 / 200 = 0.425
P(A) × P(B) = 0.1 × 0.425 = 0.0425
P(A AND B) = 5 / 200 = 0.025
Since 0.0425 is not equal to 0.025, the events are not independent.

3. Let A = “taking a gap year” and B = “going to college.”
P(A) = 0.1
P(B) = 140 / 200 = 0.7
P(A) × P(B) = 0.1 × 0.7 = 0.07
P(A AND B) = 0
Since 0.07 is not equal to 0, the events are not independent.

They are, however, mutually exclusive."
Probability,"A hospital researcher is interested in the number of times the average post-op patient will ring the nurse 
during a 12-hour shift. For a random sample of 50 patients, the following information was obtained. What is the expected value?

x	|.  P(x)
0	| P(0)=4/50
1	| P(1)=8/50
2	| P(2)=16/50
3	| P(3)=14/50

0⋅4/50+1⋅8/50+2⋅16/50+3⋅14/50+4⋅6/50+5⋅2/50=2.32, the expected value is 2.32. This means that 
over many days and weeks in the hospital, post-op patients will ring the nurse an average of 2.32 times per 12-hour shift.

We write the mean as μ=2.32, and when referring to the random variable X = the number of times the 
average post-op patient will ring the nurse during a 12-hour shift, we write E[X]=2.32."
Probability,"You are playing a game by drawing a card from a standard deck and replacing it. If the card is a face card, you win $30. 
If it is not a face card, you pay $2. There are 12 face cards in a deck of 52 cards. Should you play the game?","Yes, because there is a positive expected value, and the more you play, the more likely you are to get closer to the expected value."

Probability,"Approximately 70% of statistics students do their homework in time for it to be collected and graded. Each student does homework
 independently. In a statistics class of 50 students, what is the probability that at least 40 will do their homework on time?

a. This is a binomial problem because there is only a success or a  ____ , there are a fixed number of trials, and the probability 
of a success is 0.70 for each trial.

b. If we are interested in the number of students who do their homework on time, then how do we define X?

Probability,"Suppose 55% of people pass the state driver’s exam on the first try. You survey fifty randomly chosen adults in the state.

Which of these are binomial problems?

1. The number of the adults who have a driver’s license.
2. The number of the adults who got their driver’s license on the first try.
3. The number of times each adult has taken the driver’s exam.","The first two of the three options can be modeled as a binomial random variable.

In the first scenario, success is having a driver’s license, and each person either does or does not have a current driver’s license. We have n =50 
 trials. Since the adults are drawn randomly among the state’s population, we just need to know the percentage of adults in the state that have a 
driver’s license, then it can be modeled as a binomial random variable.

The second option, where we ask not only if they have a driver’s license, but if they got it on their first try, is a binomial problem. 
There is only a success or a failure – they did, or did not, get it on the first try — and there is a definite number of trials (each person gets one first try for 
n=50). The probability of a success stays the same for each trial at p=0.55 and we can write X~B(50,0.55).

The third option is not binomial. We may get any number of different responses, since it is quite probable that some of these adults took more than one try to pass the exam."
Probability,"According to a Gallup poll, 60% of American adults prefer saving over spending. Let  X =
 the number of American adults out of a random sample of 50 who prefer saving to spending.

1. What is the probability distribution for X?
2. Use your calculator to find the following probabilities:
    i. the probability that 25 adults in the sample prefer saving over spending
    ii.the probability that at most 20 adults prefer saving
    iii.The probability that more than 30 adults prefer saving
3. Using the formulas, calculate the (i) mean and (ii) standard deviation of X.","1. X∼B(50,0.6)

We are interested in AT LEAST 70% of ten questions correct. 70% of ten is seven. 
We want to find the probability that X is greater than or equal to seven. The event “at least seven” is the complement of “less than or equal to six”.
Using your calculator’s distribution menu: 1 – binomcdf(10, .5, 6) gives 0.171875
The probability of getting at least 70% of the ten questions correct when randomly guessing is approximately 0.172."
Probability,"An emergency room at a particular hospital gets an average of five patients per hour. A doctor wants to know the probability that 
the ER gets more than five patients per hour. Give the reasons why this would be a Poisson distribution.",This problem wants to find the probability of events occurring in a fixed interval of time with a known average rate (5 per hour). The events are independent.
Probability,"On May 13, 2013, starting at 4:30 PM, the probability of low seismic activity for the next 48 hours in Alaska was reported as about 
1.02%. Use this information for the next 200 days to find the probability that there will be low seismic activity in ten of the next 200
 days. Use both the binomial and Poisson distributions to calculate the probabilities. Are they similar?","Binomial Solution
Let 𝑋= the number of days with low seismic activity with 𝑋∼𝐵(200,0.0102).
Then 𝑃(𝑋=10)=binompdf(200,0.0102,10)≈0.000039.

Poisson Solution
Let 𝑋= the number of days with low seismic activity with 𝜇=200⋅0.0102=2.04, so 𝑋∼𝑃(2.04).
Then 𝑃(𝑋=10)=poissonpdf(2.04,10)≈0.000045.

Since 𝑛 is bigger than 20 ( 𝑛=200 ) and 𝑝 is small ( 𝑝=0.0102<0.05 ), we expect the approximation from the Poisson to be good. 
The results are very similar, with both probabilities being near zero. Ten days of seismic activity is not very likely."
Probability,"Ace Heating and Air Conditioning Service finds that the amount of time a repairman needs to fix a
furnace is uniformly distributed between 1.5 and four hours. Let x = the time needed to fix a
furnace. Then x ~ U (1.5, 4).
1. Find the probability that a randomly selected furnace repair requires more than two hours.
2. Find the probability that a randomly selected furnace repair requires less than three hours.
3. Find the 30th percentile of furnace repair times.
4. The longest 25% of furnace repair times take at least how long? (In other words: find the
minimum time for the longest 25% of repair times.) What percentile does this represent?
5. Find the mean and standard deviation ","1. To find f(x): f (x) = 1 / (4 - 1.5) = 1 / 2.5 so f(x) = 0.4
P(x > 2) = (base)(height) = (4 – 2)(0.4) = 0.8
Uniform Distribution between 1.5 and four with shaded area between two and four representing
the probability that the repair time x is greater than two. 

2. P(x < 3) = (base)(height) = (3 – 1.5)(0.4) = 0.6
The graph of the rectangle showing the entire distribution would remain the same. However the
graph should be shaded between x = 1.5 and x = 3. Note that the shaded area starts at x = 1.5 rather
than at x = 0; since X ~ U (1.5, 4), x can not be less than 1.5.
Uniform Distribution between 1.5 and four with shaded area between 1.5 and three representing
the probability that the repair time x is less than three. 

3. Uniform Distribution between 1.5 and 4 with an area of 0.30 shaded to the left, representing the
shortest 30% of repair times. 
P (x < k) = 0.30
P(x < k) = (base)(height) = (k – 1.5)(0.4)
0.3 = (k – 1.5) (0.4); Solve to find k:
0.75 = k – 1.5, obtained by dividing both sides by 0.4
k = 2.25 , obtained by adding 1.5 to both sides
The 30th percentile of repair times is 2.25 hours. 30% of repair times are 2.5 hours or less. 

4. Uniform Distribution between 1.5 and 4 with an area of 0.25 shaded to the right representing the
longest 25% of repair times. 

P(x > k) = 0.25
P(x > k) = (base)(height) = (4 – k)(0.4)
0.25 = (4 – k)(0.4); Solve for k:
0.625 = 4 − k,
obtained by dividing both sides by 0.4 
−3.375 = −k,
obtained by subtracting four from both sides: k = 3.375
The longest 25% of furnace repairs take at least 3.375 hours (3.375 hours or longer).
Note: Since 25% of repair times are 3.375 hours or longer, that means that 75% of repair times are
3.375 hours or less. 3.375 hours is the 75th percentile of furnace repair times. 

5.  μ= a+b / 2 and σ= sqrt [ (b-a)^2/12)]
 μ= 1.5+4 / 2 = 2.75 hours and σ= sqrt [ (4-1.5)^2/12)] =0.7217 hours"
Probability,"At a police station in a large city, calls come in at an average rate of four calls per minute. Assume
that the time that elapses from one call to the next has the exponential distribution. Take note that
we are concerned only with the rate at which calls come in, and we are ignoring the time spent on
the phone. We must also assume that the times spent between calls are independent. This means
that a particularly long delay between two calls does not mean that there will be a shorter waiting
period for the next call. We may then deduce that the total number of calls received during a time
period has the Poisson distribution.
1. Find the average time between two successive calls.
2. Find the probability that after a call is received, the next call occurs in less than ten seconds.
3. Find the probability that exactly five calls occur within a minute.
4. Find the probability that less than five calls occur within a minute.
5. Find the probability that more than 40 calls occur in an eight-minute period. ","1. On average there are four calls that occur per minute, so 15 seconds, or 15/60 = 0.25 minutes,
occur between successive calls on average.

2. Let T = time elapsed between calls. From part a, μ = 0.25, so m = 1/0.25 = 4. Thus, T ∼ Exp(4).
The cumulative distribution function is P(T < t) = 1 – e–4t.
The probability that the next call occurs in less than ten seconds (ten seconds = 1/6 minute) is P(T < 1/6) = 1 - e^(-4*1/6) = 0.4866

3. Let X = the number of calls per minute. As previously stated, the number of calls per minute
has a Poisson distribution, with a mean of four calls per minute.
Therefore, X ∼ Poisson(4), and so P(X = 5) = [(4^5) * (e^-4)] / 5! ≈ 0.1563. (5! = (5)(4)(3)(2)(1))
poissonpdf(4, 5) = 0.1563.

4. Keep in mind that X must be a whole number, so P(X < 5) = P(X ≤ 4).
To compute this, we could take P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4).
Using technology, we see that P(X ≤ 4) = 0.6288.
poisssoncdf(4, 4) = 0.6288

5. Let Y = the number of calls that occur during an eight minute period.
Since there is an average of four calls per minute, there is an average of (8)(4) = 32 calls
during each eight minute period.
Hence, Y ∼ Poisson(32). Therefore, P(Y > 40) = 1 – P (Y ≤ 40) = 1 – 0.9294 = 0.0707.
1 – poissoncdf(32, 40). = 0.0707"
Probability,"In a small city, the number of automobile accidents occur with a Poisson distribution at an average
of three per week.
1. Calculate the probability that there are at most 2 accidents that occur in any given week.
2. What is the probability that there is at least two weeks between any 2 accidents? ","1. Let X = the number of accidents per week, so that X ∼ Poisson(3). We need to find P(X ≤ 2)
≈ 0.4232
poissoncdf(3, 2)
2. Let T = the time (in weeks) between successive accidents.
Since the number of accidents occurs with a Poisson distribution, the time between accidents
follows the exponential distribution.
If there are an average of three per week, then on average there is μ = 1/3 of a week between
accidents, and the decay parameter is m = 1 / (1/3) = 3.
To find the probability that there are at least two weeks between two accidents, P(T > 2) = 1
– P(T < 2) = 1 – (1 – e(–3)(2)) = e
–6 ≈ 0.0025.

a. Calculate the interquartile range (IQR). 
b. Forty percent of the ages that range from 13 to 55+ are at least what age?","a. IQR = Q3 – Q1

b. Find k where P(x > k) = 0.40 (“At least” translates to “greater than or equal to.”)
0.40 = the area to the right.
Area to the left = 1 – 0.40 = 0.60.
The area to the left of k = 0.60.

Hypothesis Testing,"Suppose the null hypothesis, H0, is: a patient is not sick. Which type of error has the
greater consequence, Type I or Type II?","The error with the greater consequence is the Type II error: the patient will be thought well
when, in fact, he is sick, so he will not get treatment. "
Hypothesis Testing,"“Red tide” is a bloom of poison-producing algae—a few different species of a class of plankton
called dinoflagellates. When the weather and water conditions cause these blooms, shellfish such
as clams living in the area develop dangerous levels of a paralysis-inducing toxin. In Massachusetts,
the Division of Marine Fisheries (DMF) monitors levels of the toxin in shellfish by regular sampling
of shellfish along the coastline. If the mean level of toxin in clams exceeds 800 μg (micrograms) of
toxin per kg of clam meat in any area, clam harvesting is banned there until the bloom is over and
levels of toxin in clams subside. Describe both a Type I and a Type II error in this context, and state
which error has the greater consequence. ","In this scenario, an appropriate null hypothesis would beH0: the mean level of toxins is at most 800
μg, H0 : μ0 ≤ 800 μg.
Type I error: The DMF believes that toxin levels are still too high when, in fact, toxin levels are at
most 800 μg. The DMF continues the harvesting ban.
Type II error: The DMF believes that toxin levels are within acceptable levels (are at least 800 μg)
when, in fact, toxin levels are still too high (more than 800 μg). The DMF lifts the harvesting ban.
This error could be the most serious. If the ban is lifted and clams are still toxic, consumers could
possibly eat tainted food. "

cure rate that is less than 75%.
In this scenario, the Type II error contains the more severe consequence. If a patient believes the
drug works at least 75% of the time, this most likely will influence the patient’s (and doctor’s)
choice about whether to use the drug as a treatment option. "

Hypothesis Testing,"A college football coach thought that his players could bench press a mean weight of 275 pounds. It
is known that the standard deviation is 55 pounds. Three of his players thought that the mean
weight was more than that amount. They asked 30 of their teammates for their estimated
maximum lift on the bench press exercise. The data ranged from 205 pounds to 385 pounds. The
actual different weights were (frequencies are in parentheses)
205(3)215(3)225(1)241(2)252(2)265(2)275(2)313(2)316(5)338(2)341(1)345(2)368(2)385(1).
Conduct a hypothesis test using a 2.5% level of significance to determine if the bench press mean is
more than 275 pounds. ","Since the problem is about a mean weight, this is a test of a single population mean.
H0: μ = 275
Ha: μ > 275
This is a right-tailed test.
Calculating the distribution needed:
Random variable: X¯= the mean weight, in pounds, lifted by the football players.
Distribution for the test: It is normal because σ is known.
X¯N (275, 55/sqrt(30)) 
x¯ = 286.2 pounds (from the data). 
σ = 55 pounds, We assume μ = 275 pounds unless our data shows us otherwise.
p value = P(x¯ > 286.2) = 0.1323

Calculate the p-value using the normal distribution for a mean and using the sample mean as input:
Interpretation of the p-value: If H0 is true, then there is a 0.1331 probability (13.23%) that the
football players can lift a mean weight of 286.2 pounds or more. Because a 13.23% chance is large
enough, a mean weight lift of 286.2 pounds or more is not a rare event. 

Compare α and the p-value:
α = 0.025 p-value = 0.1323
Make a decision: Since α <p-value, do not reject H0.
Conclusion: At the 2.5% level of significance, from the sample data, there is not sufficient evidence
to conclude that the true mean weight lifted is more than 275 pounds.

senators.
H0: µ1 ≤ µ2 H0: µ1 – µ2 ≤ 0

The words “older than” translates as a “>” symbol and goes into Ha. Therefore, this is a right-tailed test.
Distribution for the test: The distribution is the normal approximation to the Student’s t for means,
independent groups. Using the formula, the distribution is:

X1¯ - X2¯ ~ N [ 0, sqrt [ (9.55^2 / 30) + (10.17^2 / 30)]

Σ xᵢ log yᵢ = A Σ xᵢ + B Σ xᵢ² (E.2)

where A = log a and B = b log e.

Solving the two normal equations (E.1) and (E.2), we get

A = 2.0802 and B = -0.0203

Hence,
a = antilog of A = 10^{2.0802} = 120.2818

and
b = B / log e = -0.0203 / log e = -0.0075

Hence, the fitted equation is
y = 120.2818 · e^{-0.0075x}

Given
x·yᵃ = b  (E.1)

Taking logarithms (to the base 10) on both sides of the above Eq. (E.1), we get

log x + a log y = log b  (E.2)

(1/a) log x + log y = (log b)/a  (E.3)

The normal equations are given by

ΣY = 6A + BΣX
ΣXY = AΣX + BΣX²

(where Y = log y, X = log x, A = (1/a) log b, and B = -1/a)

Solving Eqs. (E.4) and (E.5), we obtain

A = 1.4865 and B = -0.6154

Therefore,
a = -1/B = -1 / -0.6154 = 1.6250
and
b = antilog of (aA) = 10^{(1.6250)(1.4865)} = 260.3529

Hence, the fitted equation is
x·y^{1.6250} = 260.3529

The normal equations are obtained as follows:
y = a*b^x
Taking logarithms (base 10) on both sides of the above Eq. (E.1), we get
log y = log a + x log b (E.2)
or Y = A + Bx (E.3)
where Y = log y, A = log a and B = log b.
Hence, the normal equations are
∑Y = nA + B∑x (E.4)
∑xY = A∑x + B∑x^2 (E.5)
Substituting the values from Table 6.9 (a) into Eqs. (E.4) and (E.5), we have
11.1920 = 5A + 15B (E.6)
34.2113 = 15A + 55B (E.7)
Solving Eqs. (E.6) and (E.7), we obtain
A = 2.0478 and B = 0.0635
Hence, a = antilog of A = 10^2.0478 = 111.6349
b = antilog of B = 10^0.0635 = 1.1574
Hence, the fitted equation is y = 111.6349(1.1574)^x. "
